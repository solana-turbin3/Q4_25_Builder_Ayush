# TS Client Logic

## Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use TypeScript for Client side development?

- Typescript is widely used in both Web Development and Mobile Development.I think just like python is more suitable for data related tasks, Typescript is more suitable for building applications by integrating multiple things together to create seamless user experiences.

- Most of the web libraries/frameworks are based on JS/TS like React, Angular, Vue etc. So it makes sense to use TS for client side development. Typescrip also has a very easy learning curve compared to other languages like Rust, Go etc. which are more suitable for backend development.

- JS/TS has a rich ecosystem of libraries tools and resources and integrations with deloyment tools hence makes much easier to build and ship.

- Type safety is something which does not need any introductions as its one of the main features of TS and helps in preventing many common errors during development.

- Browser Extensions are also mostly built using JS/TS, making it easier to integrate with web applications.
